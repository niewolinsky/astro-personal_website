				<h1>Web Developer</h1>
				<p>
					Welcome to my personal website. My name is Przemysław
					Niewoliński. I am a junior web developer. I like programming
					in general, but I am most interested in the anything related
					to web technologies - websites, web applications & cloud.
					There is something inherently fascinating about code being
					live, available on the internet and potentially used by
					millions at the same time. I like simplicity and when it
					comes to code, I consider myself a minimalist - ship as
					little code as possible with clean architecture in mind.
